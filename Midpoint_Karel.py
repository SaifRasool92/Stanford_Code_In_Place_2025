When you finish writing this file, Karel should be able to find
the midpoint

PSEUDOCODE

START STATE: Karel is at (1,1) facing EAST
ASSUMPTIONS: There are infinite beepers in the beeper bag
WORLD      : N X N where N>=1
GOAL STATE: Karel is at (1,N/2)

STEPS:
1. Place Beepers along the first row
2. Move Karel back to (1,1)
3. As long as beepers are present, remove the beepers one each from the
   beginning and end till the beeper at mid-point is remaining.
